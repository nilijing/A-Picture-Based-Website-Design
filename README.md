# A-Picture-based-Website-Design


### Main functions and technical characteristics of image-based sharing websites
A picture-based sharing website is a social platform built through pictures. All users can collect, like, share, and other basic operations through pictures on this platform. The design adopts mainstream B/S three-tier architecture technology, C#, ASP.NET, and other technologies. 

This website has the following characteristics:

- Users' functions separation settings. Separate the permissions of registered users from unregistered users, separate personal settings and public browsing permissions, and set prompts to remind users of possible errors in operations, making it easy for users to use the various functions of the website. There are also certain requirements for the security of web design. Many services and functions, such as login and registration, require multiple inputs of passwords, and each mailbox can only be registered once, ensuring the security of user accounts.

- A unified style of the website. The simple design presents a fresh style. The waterfall flow technology is applied to make the layout of the webpage neat and to ensure that the complete web content is presented in a limited space. The description of the text content and the picture display are relatively compact and concentrated, but closely related, reflecting the design characteristics of pictures-based. Insert bootstrap, flexible UI design for font typography, form, button, navigation, and other components, and Javascript extension, making the development of dynamic web pages and web applications easier.
